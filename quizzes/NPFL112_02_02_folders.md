# File system beyond your home

## Your home folder is among home folders of other users of AIC Jupyter Lab. If you consider each folder one user, how many users have their home folders on AIC Jupyter Lab? (take the closest number if none fits completely) 

1. (X) 675
2. 1249
3. many more than the other options


## See R Help for `file.copy`. How would you copy folder `02` from `cinkova` to your home (not containing any folder named `02`)?

1. `file.copy(from = "./cinkova/02", to = "02", recursive = TRUE)`
2. `file.copy(from = "../cinkova/02, to = "~")`
3. (X) `file.copy(from = "../cinkova/02", to = "~", recursive = TRUE, overwrite = FALSE`
